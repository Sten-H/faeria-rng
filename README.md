# Rage Assistant
Faeria is a collectible card game and as with all card games you are always the unluckiest person alive. But just saying "I'm so unlucky" isn't always enough. Rage Assistant will give you hard numbers in how many games out of a thousand you would have drawn your desired card(s) or combination of cards

## todo
* Make nicer for smaller screens. I should use "py-sm-x" or something like that to increase card padding when card columns is only 1 column, the cards melt together vertically right now.
* Look into FAQ card expanding slow down, might have to do with it extending body which has a gradient background
* would like to try babel so I can use es6 import/export
* try some more to calculate for draw mulligans. Start with an easy example or {needed: 1 deck: 1}
